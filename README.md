# Search Movie or Series in API

This is a Python program that allows you to search for movies or series through an api that returns a JSON file containing the movie or series data.

The program consists of one main feature:

1. The user must choose between two options, the simplified return or complete return for the desired series or movie, the simplified return consists of returning only the title, genre and plot, while the complete return consists of bringing all the information of the present film in the API. After the initial choice, the program will ask the user which movie or series he wants to search for and will then put the information on the screen.
